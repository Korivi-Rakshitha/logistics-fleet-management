# ✅ SQLite Error - FIXED!

## 🐛 The Problem:

Backend was showing:
```
SQLITE_ERROR
GET /api/deliveries/stats 500
```

## 🔧 Root Cause:

The `getDeliveryStats` method in `Delivery.js` was using **MySQL-specific** function:
- `TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, actual_pickup_time, actual_delivery_time)`

This doesn't work in SQLite!

## ✅ The Fix:

Changed to **SQLite-compatible** date calculation:
- `(julianday(actual_delivery_time) - julianday(actual_pickup_time)) * 24 * 60`

This calculates the difference in minutes between two timestamps.

---

## 📝 What Was Changed:

**File:** `backend/models/Delivery.js`

**Before (MySQL):**
```sql
TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, actual_pickup_time, actual_delivery_time)
```

**After (SQLite):**
```sql
(julianday(actual_delivery_time) - julianday(actual_pickup_time)) * 24 * 60
```

## ✅ Status:

- ✅ Backend running successfully
- ✅ Frontend compiled (warnings are OK)
- ✅ SQLite database working
- ✅ All API endpoints functional
- ✅ Add Vehicle feature working

## 🚀 Everything is Ready!

### **Servers Running:**
- ✅ Backend: http://localhost:5000
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:3000

### **Test Now:**

1. **Login as Admin:**

## 📊 What the Stats Show:

The `/api/deliveries/stats` endpoint now returns:
- **total_deliveries** - Total number of deliveries
- **completed** - Deliveries with status 'delivered'
- **cancelled** - Deliveries with status 'cancelled'
- **active** - Deliveries in progress (assigned, on_route, picked_up)
- **avg_delivery_time_minutes** - Average time from pickup to delivery

## 🎉 All Issues Resolved!

1. ✅ MySQL password issue → Converted to SQLite
2. ✅ Registration not working → Fixed .env files
3. ✅ Add Vehicle not working → Added modal
4. ✅ SQLite error → Fixed date functions

**Your application is now fully functional!** 🚀
