## 🔧 Configuration Files Created

I've created/updated these files:

1. ✅ `frontend/.env.production` - Production API URL
2. ✅ `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment config
3. ✅ `backend/server.js` - Updated CORS for Vercel
4. ✅ `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Backend URL

---

## 📊 What Each File Does

### **frontend/.env.production**
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://logistics-fleet-management.onrender.com/api
```
- Sets the backend URL for production builds
- Vercel will use this automatically

### **vercel.json**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd frontend && npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "frontend/build",
  "rewrites": [...]
}
```
- Tells Vercel where to build from
- Handles React Router routing

### **backend/server.js**
- Updated CORS to allow Vercel URLs
- Updated Socket.io CORS
- Allows credentials for authentication

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

After deployment:

✅ **Frontend URL:** `https://logistics-fleet-management.vercel.app`
✅ **Backend URL:** `https://logistics-fleet-management.onrender.com`
✅ **No CORS errors**
✅ **All features working:**
   - User registration (Customer, Driver, Admin)
   - Login with all roles
   - Admin passkey verification
   - Driver document verification
   - Create deliveries
   - Assign drivers
   - Real-time tracking
   - Map functionality

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "Cannot connect to backend"**

**Solution:**
1. Check backend is "Live" on Render
2. Test: `https://logistics-fleet-management.onrender.com/api/health`
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors

### **Issue: "CORS error"**

**Solution:**
1. Verify backend CORS settings include your Vercel URL
2. Redeploy backend on Render
3. Clear browser cache

### **Issue: "Validation failed" on signup**

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for specific error
2. Verify all required fields are filled
3. For admin: Make sure passkey is `1234`

### **Issue: "404 Not Found" on page refresh**

**Solution:**
- Already fixed with `vercel.json` rewrites
- If still happening, redeploy Vercel
