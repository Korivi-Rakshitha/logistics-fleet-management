# 🚀 Adding Create Delivery & Assign Driver Features

## What I'm Adding:

1. **Create Delivery Button** - In deliveries tab
2. **Create Delivery Modal** - Form to create new deliveries
3. **Assign Driver Button** - For each unassigned delivery
4. **Assign Driver Modal** - Select driver and vehicle

## Implementation Steps:

### 1. Backend Setup ✅
- Created `/api/users` endpoint
- Added User.findByRole() and User.getAll() methods
- Added userAPI to frontend services

### 2. Frontend Changes (In Progress):
- Add state for modals and forms
- Add "Create Delivery" button in deliveries tab
- Add "Assign Driver" button for each delivery
- Create delivery form modal
- Create assign driver modal
- Fetch drivers, customers, and vehicles
- Handle form submissions

## Files Modified:
- ✅ `backend/routes/users.js` - Created
- ✅ `backend/server.js` - Added users route
- ✅ `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added userAPI
- ⏳ `frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.jsx` - Adding modals

## Next: Updating AdminDashboard.jsx with full functionality...
